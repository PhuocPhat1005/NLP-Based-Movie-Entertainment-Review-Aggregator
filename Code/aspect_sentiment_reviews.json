            "review": "Disney's live-action Snow White is finally here, and after watching it, I can confidently say that the Magic Mirror needs a new prescription. This movie is less \"fairest of them all\" and more \"fairest at failing upwards.\" If you ever wondered what it would look like if someone took the classic 1937 animated masterpiece, ran it through a corporate buzzword generator, and then tossed in some awkward CGI for good measure-congratulations, you've found your answer!A Princess with a Personality (Kind Of?)Rachel Zegler takes on the role of Snow White, though you'd be forgiven for thinking she was actually playing a medieval TED Talk speaker. Instead of the wide-eyed, kind-hearted princess we all knew, this Snow White is a Strong Independent Woman™-because saying \"I want to be a queen, not a bride\" apparently counts as character development these days. That's right, folks, forget charming dwarfs, woodland creatures, or actual chemistry with anyone; this Snow White has dreams, and she's here to remind you about them every five minutes.But despite all that, her biggest challenge in the movie isn't even the Evil Queen-it's keeping the audience awake.Gal Gadot: Evil Queen or Instagram Influencer?Now, let's talk about Gal Gadot's Evil Queen. You'd think that playing a narcissistic, beauty-obsessed villain would be an easy fit for Hollywood, but somehow, even with all the pouting, dress-swishing, and over-the-top glowering, she ends up about as menacing as a fashion blogger with a bad attitude.Her obsession with being \"the fairest of them all\" is laughable when you realize that, well... she already is the fairest of them all. No offense to Snow White, but if the mirror told me that Gal Gadot wasn't the hottest person in the kingdom, I'd be smashing that thing to pieces too. The real villain here is the mirror's manufacturer.The Dwarfs: Now with 90% Less Dwarfs!Ah yes, the seven dwarfs-except, surprise! They're not really dwarfs anymore. Instead, we get a diverse group of CGI-enhanced \"magical creatures\" who look like they were rejected from The Lord of the Rings for being too unsettling. Imagine if a bunch of carnival performers got stuck in a blender with bad CGI, and you've got these guys.Their role in the movie? Mostly to exist, deliver unfunny one-liners, and make you wonder if we should start a petition to bring back actual actors instead of whatever motion-capture madness this is. If I wanted to spend two hours looking at weirdly animated characters, I'd just play a bad video game.The Apple FiascoWe all know the story: Evil Queen poisons apple, Snow White eats apple, Snow White falls into a death nap, and then a prince shows up to wake her with true love's kiss. Simple, right? Nope. Not in this version.Instead, we get a long, drawn-out scene where Snow White almost eats the apple, but then stops to give another speech about believing in yourself or some nonsense. And when she does finally bite it, the whole moment is ruined by some weird slow-motion effects that make it look like an overly dramatic shampoo commercial.Honestly, I was rooting for the apple at that point. Maybe if she stayed in an enchanted coma, we'd all be spared another unnecessary Disney remake.Final Verdict: The Fairest Disaster of Them AllThis movie is what happens when you take a beloved classic, strip away everything that made it charming, and replace it with corporate-approved \"modernization\" that pleases no one. It's a film that wants to be empowering, but instead feels like a checklist of forced inclusivity and soulless spectacle.Snow White (2025) is proof that sometimes, it's better to leave well enough alone. If you're looking for magic, wonder, and nostalgia, just rewatch the 1937 version. If you're looking for two hours of your life you'll never get back, then by all means, go ahead and buy a ticket.",

            "review": "Disney's latest live-action remake, Snow White (2025), is yet another attempt to cash in on nostalgia, but unfortunately, it falls flat in almost every regard. From lackluster performances to subpar CGI, this film struggles to capture the magic of the original classic.Rachel Zegler: A Miscast LeadRachel Zegler, who takes on the iconic role of Snow White, delivers a performance that feels stiff and uninspired. While she undeniably has a strong singing voice, her acting lacks the warmth and charm that made the animated Snow White so beloved. Her line delivery often comes off as forced, and she struggles to bring emotional depth to the character. Instead of exuding the innocence and kindness associated with Snow White, her portrayal feels distant and, at times, even disengaged.Weak CGI and Bland VisualsFor a film with Disney's budget, the CGI is shockingly subpar. The enchanted forest, which should have felt lush and immersive, looks artificial, and the CGI creatures lack the expressiveness and charm of their animated counterparts. The dwarfs-who have been controversially reimagined-look awkward and unnatural, making it hard to emotionally invest in their presence. The visual effects in Snow White feel rushed, and instead of enhancing the experience, they serve as a constant distraction.Music: Strong Vocals, Forgettable SongsIf there's one aspect where the film slightly shines, it's Zegler's singing. She undeniably has a beautiful voice, and her vocal performances are solid. However, the new songs she's given are bland and unmemorable, failing to capture the whimsy and timeless appeal of the original soundtrack. Unlike Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid, which at least had a few standout musical moments, Snow White's soundtrack feels generic and uninspired.Conclusion: A Missed OpportunityUltimately, Snow White is another soulless live-action remake that lacks the heart and magic of the original. While Zegler's singing is a bright spot, her acting, coupled with bad CGI and uninspired musical numbers, makes this adaptation feel unnecessary. Disney had an opportunity to bring a fresh and captivating take on Snow White, but instead, they delivered a forgettable and lackluster film. Fans of the original will likely leave disappointed, longing for the charm and artistry that made the 1937 classic a masterpiece.",

            "review": "Snow White remake set out to modernize the classic fairy tale, but it ultimately leaves audiences disappointed. The film fails to stay true to the original story while also struggling to establish its own identity.First and foremost, the lifeless script is a major issue. The characters lack depth, the dialogues feel artificial, and there's no emotional connection with the audience. Key elements of the fairy tale have been altered, but rather than making the story more engaging, these changes strip it of its essence.The performances aren't particularly impressive either. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks charisma and inspiration, making the character feel ordinary and at times even unlikable. Additionally, the characters replacing the seven dwarfs are weakly designed and serve no meaningful purpose in the story.When it comes to visuals and production quality, the film is shockingly mediocre for a Disney production. The CGI looks cheap, backgrounds feel artificial, and instead of creating a magical atmosphere, the movie ends up looking dull and uninspired.Ultimately, this film feels like Disney turning its back on its own legacy. It doesn't come across as a loving modernization of a beloved classic but rather a project driven by political correctness with little artistic vision. The result? A failed adaptation that neither satisfies old fans nor captivates new audiences.Another remake where Disney continues to kill the magic of its classic animations...",

            "review": "Saw this at the cinema with my six-year-old daughter. She laughed at a few scenes but whispered, \"this is boring\" about forty five minutes in. Watched the rest but we were both happy when the movie ended.For me, the CGI was distractingly bad. I wasn't aware of the issues the film had with casting prior to the release but they should have either gone with actual actors or spent more money. It's worse than you think, and it's not just the dwarves, the forest and other scenes are poorly done.A couple of the songs were catchy but by that point I just wanted the credits to roll. Acting wise, I guess the actors had to work with what they were given, but they seemed disconnected and going through the motions. Snow white's lines sounded forced and uncommitted. A better actor might have played the role more believably but again, she had to work with what she was given. I think though, the original film had an innocence this actress didn't grasp or was unable to portray.Really, this movie seemed more like a 'direct to video' movie than a large budget Disney production. I've seen better CGI in small budget television shows and far better acting. Maybe miss this one unless your little ones really want to see it. Even then, maybe wait for it to be free on a streaming service. It's just not worth paying to see.",

            "review": "Disney's Snow White (2025) is yet another misguided attempt to modernize a classic, but instead of breathing new life into the beloved fairy tale, it strips away everything that made the original special. With uninspired performances, weak visuals, and forgettable music, this film serves as a prime example of why not every animated masterpiece needs a live-action remake.Rachel Zegler: A Snow White Lacking Charm\nCasting Rachel Zegler as Snow White seemed like an interesting choice, but unfortunately, her performance falls flat. While her singing ability is undeniable, her acting lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the character. Instead of a sweet and kindhearted princess, this Snow White comes across as distant, and at times, even uninterested in the story unfolding around her. Her line delivery feels forced, and there's little emotional connection between her and the world she's supposed to inhabit.Dull Visuals & Poor CGI\nDisney is known for its stunning animation and groundbreaking CGI, but Snow White (2025) somehow manages to look cheap and unpolished. The enchanted forest, which should have been lush and magical, looks like an over-processed video game backdrop. The CGI dwarfs, which already sparked controversy before release, look awkward and unnatural, making it even harder to connect with them emotionally. Rather than immersing the audience in a fantasy world, the visuals constantly pull you out of the experience.Music: A Forgettable Soundtrack\nThe one highlight of the film is Zegler's singing, but even that can't save the uninspired and generic new songs. Unlike Disney's previous live-action adaptations, which at least attempted to reimagine classic melodies, Snow White (2025) fails to create any memorable musical moments. The new songs lack the magic of Someday My Prince Will Come or Heigh-Ho, leaving nothing that audiences will hum after leaving the theater.Conclusion: Another Failed Remake\nSnow White (2025) is a textbook example of how not to remake a beloved film. Instead of enhancing the story, it strips away its charm and replaces it with a lifeless, forgettable adaptation. Disney had the chance to create something special, but what we got instead is yet another uninspired cash grab that fails to justify its existence. Fans of the original will likely leave the theater disappointed and frustrated, once again questioning why Disney insists on remaking its animated classics when the magic clearly isn't there.Final Verdict: 2/10 - A dull, unnecessary remake. Just rewatch the original.",

            "review": "Does this film really deserve the wave of criticism that has fallen on it? It's best to see for yourself, maybe not necessarily in the cinema, but it's worth giving it a chance and checking if this movie is really as bad as others say.To begin with, a few positives. \"Snow White\" is an acting adaptation of the cult Disney animation from 1937. The plot itself has not undergone significant changes, although instead of the classic prince from the fairy tale we get Jonathan (Andrew Burnap) - a rebel who has to earn the feelings of Snow White. Thanks to this, their relationship is different from the original - we do not have love at first sight here, but a feeling built on emotions and events lived together.The film also defends itself in terms of music. The songs, musical scenes and choreographies are well made, and the whole looks pleasant to both the eye and the ear. The humor is typically Disney - the dwarves provide a lot of funny moments that can amuse younger viewers (and even older ones).Moving on to the negatives - the biggest problem is the acting. Rachel Zegler as Snow White sings great and is obviously trying, but her acting is more like a theatrical performance, which does not necessarily fit this film. Gal Gadot in the role of the Evil Queen is even worse - her performance is downright terrible, and singing makes things even worse. The special effects are at a decent level, but the dwarves are a big minus. Their appearance is a strange mix of animation and live action, which at least doesn't work for me at all.To sum up - In my opinion, \"Snow White\" is a pretty good proposition for children who are unlikely to pay attention to imperfections - after all, it is a film aimed mainly at them. I myself had a good time at the screening, although I see its many flaws, it is certainly not as bad as the media say, but it is also far from being called very good. It is best to watch and evaluate for yourself, instead of being guided by other people's opinions :)",

Besides The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon remake being pretty good, the other remakes have remained dull, baffling, or offensive. Snow White is one of those dull ones. Covered with excessive usages of CGI and colors, the camerawork, production style and colors feel bloated and unsocial. Alongside with the bland direction, uninteresting takes of how they tell the tale and where the characters were once beloved in the animated movie, becomes lifeless and uninteresting here. The choice of using CGI dwarfs really was a bad idea because it came off as quite uncanny and unintentionally creepy to observe at times.The performances....aren't very great. Rachel Zegler does give her best as she does have solid moments including some of the voice performances from the other cast. Gal Gadot, however, her performance really didn't work at all. Gadot lacks the emotion and creep charm to what the Evil Queen should have been.Despite some good looking designs on the backgrounds and all, it was really boring. Marc Webb tries his best but unfortunately, really little about this would ever work.Please, audiences, stop giving the remakes money because they are just as responsible for the remakes to keep existing.",

            "review": "To be fair, I have thought a lot of this movie and found the conclusion that Disney does neither understand the old animated movies nor the original fairy tales.If you do a twisted fairy tale movie, okay all right, then use a different name, as was done with Frozen or Tangled or \"Mirror, Mirror\" and whatever. Of course, Disney movies are always different, but there is a high responsibility as they are regarded as cultural representation, and as a German, I really want to talk about this controversy. All right, if you need to change the back story of the name Snow White, why not simply introduce a real name. Dwarfs in fairy tales are of course not the same as people with dwarfism, and so the CGI idea with also introducing a human actor with dwarfism (with even a heroic task) could have worked, but removing simply the word dwarf does not help. How odd, as usually Disney is so careful of historical accuracy, there is silence about the obvious German connotations of both 1937 movie and the original tale. Although the love story with a guy called Jonathan is more contemporary elaborated than the insta-meet-cute with her prince, it can not evoke the same emotions as the 1937 movie. CGI animals are cute, but seriously? Snow was already in 1937 a leading lady and strong character, but Walt Disney decided to focus on a decision for love instead of power or ambition, so the political-moral connotations in this new movie are rather more backwarded than they actually are thinking. Although going the safe way with keeping definitely surprisingly many things intact from the 1937 movie, even with an old-fashioned fairy tale book opening and taking something from Cinderella live action - with amazing brightness and cheerfulness, it soon goes away from the old story into a world of reimagining. It makes me think of \"Mirror, Mirror\" with touch of the Disney Robin Hood and Tangled movies (and a bit of the German Simsala Grimm Schneewittchen version!), yet failing to showcase the kindness Snowy is constantly talking about. There could have made better use of the original tales (Brothers Grimm, but also tradition of Ludwig Bechstein, Johann Musäus and Ludwig Albert Grimm). Never much exploring the original characters, but somehow throwing in Jonathan's seven bandits as MIRRORED version to the dwarfs (these were the first version leaked, which turns out not to be the 7 \"dwarfs\",which is a good attempt to keep up a mirror structure of the main Disney couple), but so random named (Bingley?? Norwich??? Why???). Anyway, the music is charming, but reminds with \"let go, let glow\" too much of you know what I mean, also such like a reminiscence \"Waiting on a Miracle\" from Encanto. The spectacular musical scenes are very good, but a big contrast to the quiet cottage-core feeling of the 1937 movie In fact, it's a twisted remix, just like a rock/pop version of a music piece by Mozart. It might be worth as an idea offering enjoyable moments and tunes, but considering it as improvement is insane. Just like Enchanted was already a reimagining of Snow White, this is also another one and should be called in my opinion perhaps \"Mirrored\". An interesting advertisement campaign for the old movie and related products through reverse psychology. Particularly, too many Neutral ideas. \"Strong independent\" - but princess -, still not as daring as in Mirror, Mirror, here in a child costume advertisement spot, and let's not forget that girl empowerment does not work this way with an anachronistic understanding of monarchy (Disney Queen franchise?), and let us simply dream, not be lessoned...",

            "review": "Disney's Snow White (2025) is a crushing disappointment that fails to capture the magic of the 1937 classic. The film feels like a hollow shell of its predecessor, lacking the heart and charm that made the original a timeless masterpiece. Rachel Zegler's Snow White is a miscast disaster—her performance feels flat, and she lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the character. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is equally underwhelming, coming across as more of a caricature than a menacing villain. The CGI is subpar, with the dwarfs looking more creepy than endearing, and the enchanted forest appearing artificial and lifeless. The pacing drags, making the film feel much longer than its runtime, and the new songs are forgettable at best. This remake is a soulless cash grab that tarnishes the legacy of the original. Save your money and rewatch the animated classic instead.",

            "review": "I had low expectations for Disney's Snow White (2025), but somehow, it managed to be even worse than I imagined. The script is a mess, with clunky dialogue and a plot that feels disjointed and uninspired. Rachel Zegler tries her best, but her Snow White lacks the emotional depth needed to carry the film. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is laughably bad—her overacting is almost comical, but not in a good way. The visuals are a Neutral bag; some scenes look decent, but the CGI dwarfs are a disaster, looking more like rejected video game characters than the beloved companions from the original. The pacing is atrocious, with long stretches of boredom punctuated by awkward musical numbers that fail to leave an impression. This film is a textbook example of how to ruin a classic. Disney needs to stop with these soulless remakes.",

The acting is subpar—Rachel Zegler’s Snow White feels detached, and Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen lacks menace. The CGI is shockingly bad for a Disney film; the dwarfs look uncanny, and the forest scenes are flat and unconvincing. The story feels rushed in some parts and dragged out in others, making for an uneven and frustrating watch. The new songs are forgettable, and the direction feels uninspired. This film is a stark reminder of why some classics should be left alone. A rare miss for Disney.",

Rachel Zegler’s Snow White is cold and unlikable, a far cry from the sweet princess we all love. The plot deviates so much from the classic story that it feels like a completely different movie, and not in a good way. The visuals are a Neutral bag—some of the costumes are beautiful, but the CGI is awful, especially the dwarfs, who look creepy and out of place. The pacing is slow, and the new songs don’t hold a candle to the originals. I wanted to love this, but it’s a soulless remake that misses the mark entirely.",

Rachel Zegler’s Snow White is stiff and unengaging, while Gal Gadot’s Evil Queen feels like a caricature. The plot is a mess, with unnecessary changes that strip away the fairy tale’s essence. The visuals are subpar—the CGI dwarfs are creepy, and the sets look artificial. The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of boredom. The new songs are forgettable, and the direction feels uninspired. Disney needs to stop with these remakes.",

I'm not sure why it's getting so much hate but I have a few guesses. It's definitely a future family film I could revisit time and again. The visuals are satisfying and encapsulates our interest over and over again.Don't listen to the negative dreadful comments. Go enjoy a good movie.",

The charm, magic, and heart that made the classic so beloved are nowhere to be found here. Instead, we get a lifeless reimagining that feels forced, flat, and painfully out of touch.The writing is dull, the characters lack soul, and the visuals-while technically polished-can't save a film that just doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. I gave it a chance, but I honestly couldn't get through it. About a quarter of the way in, I was already losing interest... and then I literally fell asleep. That says everything.Disney really needs to stop remaking classics if they can't even come close to honoring what made them great in the first place. This one's a hard pass.",

I suggest to go watch and see for yourself if it deserves all the hate.Gal Gadot and Rachel Zegler done a great job performing. Songs and dances are wonderful, loved them all. I can see how much talent and skill went into this. So don't believe what everyone says, go and watch it.",

Her voice was just mesmerising in the movie. Her acting has also improved in this movie. This high rating is only for Rachel Zegler & her performance . On the other hand, Gal gadot's performance was hilarious. This type of poor performance is not expected from an experienced actress like her! Her acting could have been better, she needs to improve her game. The story of the movie made me nostalgic, it took me back to my childhood. The VFX of the movie wasn't as I expected! It wasn't up to the mark! Overall the movie is watchable & if you can ignore Gals acting you could enjoy the movie.",

First half of the movie is mostly very loyal to the original characters and story. The second half of the movie has some slight differences and additions to the plot of the original to help convert this from a 1930s animation to a modern 2025 live action movie. It's far from perfect of course with some cringy or cheesy bits thrown in, but it really doesn't deserve the controversy or hate towards some of the cast. It's worth seeing with children without a doubt and Rachel Zegler is a beautiful Snow White.",

The cinematography is stunning, capturing the fairy-tale world with breathtaking visuals, and the score adds to the film's enchanting yet eerie atmosphere. The plot may be predictable at times, but the lead performance is strong, carrying the emotional weight of the story. Some of the dialogue feels clunky, and the pacing drags in parts, but there are genuinely magical moments that shine. Not a masterpiece, but certainly not the disaster some are making it out to be-it's a decent reimagining that deserves a fair chance.",

Her performance made me cry at several points-it's truly moving to see her Snow White come to life. And what a stunning setting! The film truly immerses you in a fairytale kingdom, with breathtaking landscapes and a color palette that evokes both animation and the grandeur of live-action.

The visuals were stunning, the performances were heartfelt, and the music was absolutely enchanting.What frustrates me the most is that this film was torn apart before it even had a chance! People judged it before seeing it, without giving it the opportunity to shine. But it does shine-brightly! It's a film full of joy, adventure, and pure Disney magic.This is a movie I wholeheartedly wish upon the world, and I hope that one day it will find a well-deserved place on Broadway. It has everything a great musical needs-memorable songs, lovable characters, and a story that touches the heart. The stage would be the perfect home for this incredible tale.And let's talk about Dopey-he is, without a doubt, the star of the show! His charm, humor, and warmth stole every scene, and I couldn't help but fall in love with his character all over again.If you're on the fence about watching this film, I urge you to give it a chance. It deserves to be seen, to be celebrated, and to be remembered as the magical experience that it is.",

            "review": "Rachel Zegler plays a more self-reliant Snow White, who isn't just waiting for a prince but actively shaping her own destiny. Andrew Burnap's Jonathan takes his place as a new love interest, though their relationship is more of a slow burn than a fairy-tale romance.Gal Gadot's Evil Queen meets a completely different fate. Instead of falling off a cliff, she's trapped in her own enchanted mirror, forced to watch as Snow White thrives.Waiting on a Wish is Snow White's big solo, replacing Someday My Prince Will Come, making it clear she's dreaming of a future she builds herself. A Hand Meets a Hand, her duet with Jonathan, hints at romance but keeps things ambiguous.Visually, the film is breathtaking, but its biggest controversy will be the CGI dwarfs. This creative choice may divide audiences, but it leans into the film's more mystical, nature-focused tone.I grew up with the original, so I was ready to be annoyed at all the changes, but somehow, they work. If you're going in expecting a frame-for-frame remake, this isn't it. But if you're open to a new take, it's absolutely worth watching. I left the theater actually thinking about it, which is more than I can say for most Disney remakes.",

Brings the disney magic to life, and the blend of CGI and real life sets add a depth that isnt present in some other movies.A strong, reimagined version of a Disney classic. Enjoyed by 3 generations in my family, from ages 9 to 60.Gal's singing wasn't the strongest but she played a brilliantly evil Queen.Rachel's talent is exceptional for someone so young.The supporting cast were brilliant and the dwarves were hilarious and heart felt.They managed to get heart into even the CGI animals. A thoroughly enjoyable, magical movie.",

It's a modern retelling that brings new life to the story while still keeping it heart. Zegler delivers a strong heartfelt performance as a Snow White. She brings warmth & charm to the rile, making her feel like a real person rather than just a passive princess. The Visuals are gorgeous, the costumes are stunning.It's disappointing to see so much unnecessary negativity around this movie. If you actually watch it for what it is. Not for what people on the internet claim. It's a beautifully made movie with a lot of heart.If you also loves fairytales, Give Snow White a Chance. It just might surprise you!.",

The only part that I couldnt really embrace was the CGI dwarves. But they too became endearing. Loved that they kept the classics in.. Hi Ho, Hi Ho.. loved the visuals.. just wished the stylist styled Rachel better..So, what was right with it? ..well almost everything except Snow White's dress. It looked cheap.. like crepe material.. other than that the remodernised version is resonates with that of an empowered princess.. I just did not like Gal Gadit's potrayal.. she definitely isn't a singer..But it was not bad at all.",

The visuals of the Castle, the town, the cute animals as well as the design of the dungeon with the transformation into the old hag were the strong points However, I still felt that the CGI of the dwarfs could be improved but still convincing and entertaining enough. The reinterpretation was compelling. The evil queen seems more humanized. And got more than just angry facial expressions. Rachel did her best and I could feel snow white in her. Even though she's not that white, it affected nothing and I didn't feel anything about it honestly. The plot and re- interpretation gave valid reasons including why she's got the hairstyle she's got. And most importantly I love the idea that they changed Snow White's mindset to feel for her people and the need for the kingdom to be saved by her rather than having a great husband who would save her.",

This was much better than I had expected, few scary bits in the forest but my 4 year old was ok. The Evil queen could have been a bit more intimidating and had a bit more especially as the crone, but I thought Snow white was good. I liked the bandits rather than a random Prince as well. The changes worked and though it felt a little dumbed down in parts they kept enough of the cartoon elements to be nostalgic whilst updating the story for 2020s.",

Yes, Snow White's acting could be better, but it wasn't awful. I like that the love theme stayed in the movie and wasn't just about a strong woman leader. My biggest complaint is that they used CGI for the dwarves. I understand why though (to maintain their familiarity with the original) but using real dwarfs would of been better. It was quite disturbing that there was a real dwarf in the movie...but it was 1 of the bandits. Overall, id recommend seeing the moving and not believing all the negativity.",

            "review": "I've literally never written a review before and I felt compelled to once I saw how many 1 star reviews there were. Was it exactly like the original? No. Was Gal Gadot able to prove to me she can act? Also no. But it's not as bad as people are making it out to be. Rachel Z sang beautifully. The dwarves were funny and nostalgic. And overall I enjoyed the new additions of songs. The script could use a little work but I think compared to some other Disney remakes this one managed to keep the magic and pay homage to the original songs it out it being a carbon copy. Another area that needed improvement was the addition of the character Jonathan. I liked the bandit aspect but he felt one noted and I was distracted by his skater looking outfit. Gal gadot should have never been casted in this or any film. She can't act and her monotone voice was annoying to me the entire film. That being said she looked spectacular in costume but they should have given her a prosthetic nose. I loved the new song Waiting on a Wish. It felt very reminiscent of the 90s Disney films. The other new songs were not to bad but I really enjoyed the musical theater choreography of it all. The best part of the film was 100% the costumes and set. I loved the colors and the scene where Snow runs in to the woods and makes her way to the dwarves house was especially impressive. Thank you for keeping the dwarves the same Disney! And for all those looking for a reviewer that isn't afraid of a little social commentary or change I say go in with an open mind and don't expect perfection just enjoy the nostalgia of it all.",

I appreciate the expansion of the story and how it has been updated. Film begins by establishing Snow Whites background and early childhood, showing her parents positively influencing her. The wishing well is where you wish to find out who you can be, not a place to wish for a prince to someday come. The eventual male love interest is not a prince, either, being more in the Tangled mode of ruffian with a heart of gold. The animation of the dwarves and the mines is overblown, but a couple of the characters grow on you, in particular Doc, Grumpy, and Dopey, the later of whom gets some lovely growth as a character. What I found unfortunate was the miscasting of Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. She does not have the pipes for the songs she was given, which were forgettable. As a whole, it is an improvement over the almost literal live action remakes of some of the other Disney animation classics. By updating the story, yes, being \"woke\", the 2025 version of Snow White justifies its existence.",

I was extremely proud of her for building a strong chemistry towards the 7 cgi dwarfs. Number 3. I love the way the dwarfs act towards one another. Number 4. It definitely has a strong meaning to this live Disney remake My only one complaint is Gal playing the main villain. It should've been given to someone else. That will give it there all.",

She surprisingly have life to Snow White (just ignore her bad wig, I still don't understand what the costume department was thinking.) Dopey (loved the changes made to his character) Jonathan and the way he was integrated to the story (Prince Charming was one of the weakest aspects of the original animated) Character motivations also kind of worked for me. What didn't work: Gal Gadot. Horrible acting. Completely miscast. Her scenes took me out of the movie. Rest of the bandits seemed insignificant and had no development. Low screentime for the Dwarves. They felt tacked on to the story. Somewhat lackluster visuals. Felt a bit dull at times. Inconsistent pacing. Overall, good enough watch. Some aspects felt better than the original animated to me personally. I wish Rachel Zegler wouldn't have ruined the marketing of the movie, because her off-screen behaviour kept lingering in my mind throughout the movie, no matter how hard I tried to separate the art from the artist.",

            "review": "#SnowWhite is an absolute visual feast! They pretty much did the original story mix with some of the original grim Brothers story and added some new things. Acting was pretty much good for the whole film. The only thing I think they could've done better, was to make Gal Gadot do a little bit more evil as an evil queen. Rachel was very good at playing Snow White. Some songs were added, which I don't think needed to. I don't think the film deserves as much hate it's getting yes it's not perfect or amazing, but I enjoyed a lot of it! My personal opinion for people is to not pay attention to the negative reviews and just going with an open mind that that's how I went in even though there were negative reviews that I read I was nervous going in, but I'm still happy I saw it! My rotten tomatoes 🍅 score would be 70% not a 46% like they gave it.",

            "review": "Firstly the look of this movie felt very faithful to Disney and what I expected from a live action adaptation. I think the dwarfs are going to probably be hit or miss for adults I can understand that personally I not sure how I feel but my little sister was enchanted she didnt see them as out of place and I think children are the target audience (my sister is 10). The story over all is charming, I like that her love interest is a normal boy, rom the way people talked about this movie I didnt think there would be a love interest but there is and they have a lovely chemistry. It does have some moments where things don't connect story wise but like what movie doesn't just wish I understood more what the dwarfs did in the end. Rachel Zegler's performance and voice, OMG her voice, definitely a highlight of this film, no notes her signing was flawless. Gal Gadot's performance was a little stiffer then I expected, not bad just not what I expected since she was amazing in Wonder Woman, but she's a wicked witch so maybe it was a story choice. Overall a good live adaption to Disneys catalogue and I think young girls will love it, it shows them you can be strong, lead and have love. Seeing my little sister smiling and chatting about the movie all the way home it won her over and I think for these movies thats the main point.",

I even enjoyed the dwarfs. I'm not sure why people disliked it so much. I've always liked Gal Galdot. I'm not sure that she's a singer but it was a good effort. Rachel Zegler did a fine job The set and costumes were beautiful. I really liked the dwarfs' cottage and I liked the reinvention of the classic songs. Being a fan of all the original Disney cartoons I know that there are limitations on what they can do with live action productions and I think they did a decent job on this production.",

As a 40+ year old avid movie goer, I found this to be a nice rendition of the Grimm fairy tale. I liked the actresses in their roles. I felt that the lead roles had more depth than the original cartoon characters, but the original was a cartoon, so I expected that should occur. The dwarfs' reactions to Snow White's poison apple death brought tears to my eyes. I also enjoyed the new songs and the removal of songs that did not fit this narrative. It was a good movie in that it held my attention, made me want to see the plotline through to the end and wasn't just about a princess waiting for her prince to rescue you her from her life and all the danger.",

Snow White is beautifully re-imagined and is perfect for young children. An emotional journey with new songs as well as classics. A showcase for a battle between good and evil represented in a manner suitable for children. No parent wants to have a child burst into tears or leave the cinema white as a ghost. Disney and Disney theme parks are all about bringing joy to the children and adults who visit. This movie lives up to that special magic with uplifting songs and dance. Re telling the story for all, with happiness, with sadness and just a touch of darkness. In my opinion the actors gave a very ebullient performance. Even the evil queen manages a smile here and there. See the movie without making comparisons to the original. Judge the movie on how you feel after and I am sure it will be thumbs up. If not you can always give thumbs down to this review.",

Rachel has an undeniable amazing voice, she was great on the movie, but her hair style and costume were terrible. Gal was spectacular as the Evil Queen, on the other side her costume and hairpieces were stuning, same for the guard costumes. The story was pretty similar to the original, not really significant big changes. I really enjoy the pacing of the movie, and the acting was accordingly to what's needed for a musical. No complains on that part. The songs were the best part of the movie. Even the dwarfs were kind of weird for the firat few min but then you just get used to them. I think Dopey and Doc got all the love from the CGI team. Entertaining and great movie to watch with the family. Worst part of the movie, the bandits.",

            "review": "Or do actually. Here's why: I've just left the theatre and think this is a new age, war driven \"no wireeeee hanggerrrrrrssss\" performance. This movie is a pretty faithful adaptation to the animated version. There's a bit more dialogue and a lot more singing. But the story is the same? I didn't expect that. The CGI was not as distracting as I suspected? Definitely didn't expect that. And the entire cast did great except she who must not be named. GG should have her Hollywood star removed because of this performance. I don't personally like her acting choices, or lack ever thereof. And I find her politically to be in the same camp. She's been a major skip and I hope this solidifies her unbankability going forward. She, like the apple she gives out is box office poison. Her costumes were as horrible as her performance was campy. And I do not mean like good The Substance camp, nor But I'm a Cheerleader camp, just really really bad Joan Crawford impressionist camp. The castle might've been a literal putt putt course? And the seven emotions in human form were a little uncanny valley vibes at times but I think lord farquad Snow White did good in her 507 songs that she sang running through the forest hiding in the worlds brightest yellow dress you've ever seen. There were a lottttt of similarities in the script to the ongoing war in the Middle East, with Gal as the rightful villain but I'm not sure that the studio knows that it even did that. Nor that she's aware, clearly. It's either a brilliant calculation or a \"mistake\" on Disney's part. Rachel (lord farquad snow) has spoken out advocating for history's correct side and her being on the run from terror was honestly about as close to reality any Disney movie has ever gotten. With or without that recognition, the movie isn't that bad. It's pretty faithful to the source. And in this day and age... it might be important to reflect on these listed comparisons.",

The digital dwarfs: horrible design , looks out of place, they tried and failed. 3. The main cast: I think Rachel Ziegler is very talented, she can act and she can sing, but she definitely was miscasted for this role, she looks like a parody, talent is not enough when you are forcing into character. Gal Gadot is very limited with her acting resources. I agree she looks amazing, but this is above her skills. 3 things I liked: 1. The songs: I feel this being a musical works perfectly and the new songs were great additions. 2. The scenarios and ambient: the castle, the town, the woods, the cabin, I really liked all of that, it feels out of the original, very fairy tale, 3. The story: I don't get the hate, but the story works. The changes are minimal and not relevant to make it bad, it's a different approach and I genuinely believe they give a different perspective to the take. If different actresses portrayed the main roles nobody would be complaining about the story.",

I liked the new songs and the choreo and direction within them. I thought the costumes were spot on and smiled when we saw Snow White in her traditional dress in the woods. I also liked Rachel Ziegler in the role. Her character had an edge to her which I didn't think I was going to like but her direction and the more determined characterisation, I think, suited her. I liked the CGI 'dwarfs' , each one reminding us in subtle ways of the quirks which gave them their names. I found Dopey adorable... The CGI woodland animals were very very cute. Yes, there are some parts of the story which have been updated but not to the extent that it detracts or ruins the plot. So what if the male lead and 'dwarfs' all work as a team with Snow White to bring down the evil queen standing back for Snow White to take the final lead - love it. I would have no qualms at all taking children to see this film (one short and very well done scary bit in the wood ) and i would certainly go and see it again.",

It's a movie with occasionally sharp dialogue (although most of it is...rather dull. And some parts just directly contradict). Its shows us hoe cliché the orignal show white is, and mocks it, and then goes on to do exactly the said clichés. This movie really isn't great but Rachel Zeglers acting and wonderful singing voice made this movie worth watching in my opinion. She is a wonderful actress, and I love how she's able to portray conflicting emotions so well. I'm not a fan of the classic so maybe that's why I was able to sort of enjoy this remake despite its many flaws, it was good entertainment for a couple of hours.",

            "review": "LIKES:\nAnimation For Animals\nCostume/Makeup\nSome Dialogue Well-Written/Delivered\nSome Good Emotional Moments\nMusical Level Songs\nCute/Cuddly/Disney Modern\nVoice Acting Is Good For Me\nSolid Messages.\nSummary:\nDespite the masses calling for the head of Snow White, I found a few things I think were done well in this film. We start with the voice acting and the cast that brings it to life when it comes to the dwarves and the magic mirror. Though not as strong as the original seven, I liked the new group very much and found their techniques quite fitting for the live-action make. They embody the personalities well and add that fantasy element Disney is very efficient at making but still holds more emotion than much of the non-digital cast. These guys are the ones who deliver some of the better dialogue, a few of the live-action cast managed to drop some really powerful lines at just the right moment that will make it on the quote boards. I found those quotes often in those very heartfelt moments where everything came together, some inflections of the Disney magic sparkling the way they did in the 1900s and delivering those solid messages of kindness, fairness, and hard work to solve problems.\nWhere most of the splendor came for me in the movie is the visual effects that capture that Disney cuddliness we know the company for holding. The costumes and makeup are solid rebuilds of the cartoon design, many of them authentic nods to the times but pop with a bit of modern sheen for future cosplays. Sure, some of the costumes look a little cheaper than others, but overall, it is a better portrayal of the character than other facets. I enjoyed the songs to some degree, with a very Broadway musical ambiance radiating from them as Snow sings her way through the opening numbers and dances about with the town in new songs that Disney continues to spin out. The older numbers are very fun as well, not quite as Mystical Melody as in the past, but still holding that fun charm that I remember from the film, but could have used some more finesse and planning to be memorable. Finally, the animation for the animals was something I found to be my favorite aspect of this movie. Like Enchanted, Snow White's live adaptation puts a lot of gorgeous detail into the animals, keeping much of their physiology with just a touch of the human element to add that adorable energy to give them their own tertiary personalities. They play a rather large part in the movie, and it helps add Disney family-friendly charm for the younger audience members that modern Disney continues to keep in their films and should be enjoyable to the masses.\nDISLIKES\nPlot Is Messy\nToo Many Characters\nCGI Design Is Meh for Most\nWasted Wicked Queen\nBoring/Lacking Stakes\nThe Dance Numbers Are All The Same\nUnnecessary Musicals\nLacking Full Punch\nConflicting Story Arcs\nPredictable/Tries Too Hard\nOne Of The Weakest Climactic Endings\nA Victim of Edits and Media\nSummary:\nThat's where the likes end, unfortunately. Snow White's live remake comes with several dislikes that I feel are going to be ill-received by audiences, given what I saw. One of the biggest weaknesses for me was the new plot. Sure, the origin of her name is a bit eye-rolling, but Snow White's new tale is trying to be too many things at once and do too many arcs in a compressed time. Snow White's desire to get outside the castle is not such a simple tale as we are introduced to bandits, dwarves, more of huntsmen, evil queens, and new desires for the protagonist. The film is loaded with way too many characters, and I don't really have time to learn most of their names or stories before jumping back into another facet of this movie. The writers struggled to pick lanes and stay in them, and their plot intertwining is very messy and knotted up with frayed transitions. I found it difficult to get tied to any of the characters, none of them packing that same punch outside a few moments nor as well-layered as I know Disney can do. Even the Wicked Queen is very wasted, an antagonist with such potential drowned out by awkward plots and too many arcs competing for dominance. Yet, the worst thing is Snow White's character is too spread thin between the different \"princesses\" she has to be. This new age of remaking the character but keeping to the classic got out of hand, Zegler doing her best to play so many approaches not enough to make this a very inconsistent Snow White I didn't love or hate. When you see that a lot of the live-character actors didn't have the best acting consistency, it only further weakens the strained characters for viewers like me and makes the film boring.\nSurely, the spectacle is enough to make up for it, right? I'm sorry to say the answer is no on that one. The dance numbers are charming at times, that musical prowess present in the resonating voices, thundering instruments, and grandiose extensions of notes. However, many of the songs feel very much the same, with reprises and similar-sounding tunes that lack the variety I know Disney to have past their earlier works. The dance numbers also felt very carbon-copy, the same twirls, exchanges, and steps feeling lazy and repetitive shots that pale in comparison to shows like Wicked do so well. Even worse, the movie felt very carefree, where they inserted songs, with many of them feeling shoehorned in to get another track on the playlist. Such haphazard planning doesn't do much for me, especially when each track feels very much the same song. As for the action, this is another Snow White tale that struggles to do much with the action scenes or climatic struggles. This remake makes a show for building up drama, adding suspense with potentially losing characters at any moment before changing their mind. It's a rather safe film, with more marching and shadow work than actual action, making this feel like the second season of House of Dragons. While this is good news for parents who think any conflict is too violent, for those who like more meat to their story, you'll be subjected to some of the most anticlimactic resolutions to the story. A great theme to stick with regarding the messages, but as a spectacle, it is kind of dull in the grand scheme of Disney movies. All of these problems, I think, are due to the media coverage and the edits that came from it taking the changes too far to make a cohesive film.\nThe VERDICT:\nI can see the potential of Snow White and some of the modern elements that could have worked. Disney continues to make good visuals and world-crafting tricks, supplies Broadway-like bellows in their tracks, good voice acting for some lines, and plenty of the new cute and cuddly magic that Disney has played well with their stories. That component will make this movie enjoyable for many families to see, especially those with younger children. However, in terms of a cohesive piece, this live-action fails on many levels with its approach to trying too many things in one film. The conflicting nature of Snow White between classic and new was not fun, nor was trying to juggle many characters who weren't necessary and could have spent more time with the dwarves. Much of the acting could do little to save bland characters who had little time to enjoy, and I was bored with the predictable and anticlimactic tales that couldn't get away from the messages. Throw in repetitive song and dance numbers, and you leave me little of that fantastic factor Disney's 2-D animation was known for having. Thus, is this movie a necessity for theater viewing? I don't think it is outside of a field trip or group outing, with your time much better spent watching at home. When I factor in everything, I give Snow White:\nAdventure/Family/Musical/Fantasy/Romance: 5.5-6.0\nMovie Overall: 4.5-5.0.",

            "review": "What I liked : 1) Zegler's vocal talent and dancing. There's no doubt she can sing and no one could compare with her in this film. 2) Gal Godot's sultry look and accent. She is the biggest reason I wanted to see the movie - Gal is beautiful! Her acting wasn't superb and was a little goofy at times, and her singing had the auto tuner working overtime, but her presence commands your attention.\nWhat I didn't like: 1) Zegler's constantly changing hair bob. Every time the scene changed, and sometimes within a scene, her hair was more curly at the bob, or misplaced , or the hairstyle looked glued down and It was very inconsistent . 2) The creepy looking animated dwarves. Real life actors would have been superior. 3) The rushed and pieced together ending. It truly felt like they didn't quite know how to end this updated version of the fairytale.",
